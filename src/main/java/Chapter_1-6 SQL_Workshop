Basics about SQL:
  Many organizations manage large amounts of data. This can be better managed with a database and SQL rather than a spreadsheet. Structured data is easy to process and can be stored in a relational database in which the data have defined relationships to each other.

 Relational databases and SQL:
    Relational databases organize data in tables. In the form of rows (comments) and columns (fields), SQL is a powerful language for manipulating relational data. and is used to perform database, table, and operations such as inserting, retrieving, and data manipulation.

 SQL statement classifier:
   - DDL (Data Definition Language): means to define data structures (e.g. CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
   - DML (Data Manipulation Language): Focuses on data manipulation (e.g. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
   - DCL (Data Control Language): Controls access to data (e.g. GRANT, REVOKE).
   - TCL (Transaction Control Language): Controls database transactions (e.g. COMMIT, ROLLBACK).
   - DQL (Data Query Language): Used to search for data (e.g. SELECT).

 Creating data and tables:
   - The CREATE DATABASE command creates a new database, while CREATE TABLE creates tables in that database.
   - Example of creating a table for student data including the primary key for StudentID.

 SQL data type:
   - SQL data types categorize the types of data stored in a data set, such as numeric, symbolic, binary, and types (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE, BLOB).
   - Selecting the appropriate data type is critical to maintaining data integrity and efficient data processing.

 Inserting data into a table:
   - The INSERT INTO statement is used to add data to a table.
   - You can insert one row.
