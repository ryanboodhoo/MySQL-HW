Add two more movies of your choosing to the table.

| Scarface                |     170 | Crime/Thriller   |        8.3 | R      |
| Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman |     152 | Romance/Comedy   |        6.7 | PG     |
| Yes Boss                |     165 | Romance/Comedy   |        6.7 | PG     |
| Darr                    |     180 | Thriller/Romance |        7.6 | R      |

Create a query to find all movies in the Sci-Fi genre.
SELECT *
FROM Movies
WHERE Genre = 'Sci-Fi';

Create a query to find all films that scored at least a 6.5 on IMDB
    SELECT *
    -> FROM Movies
    -> WHERE IMDB_Score >= 6.5;

For parents who have young kids, but who don't want to sit through long children's movies, create a query to find all of the movies rated G or PG that are less than 100 minutes long.

SELECT *
FROM Movies
WHERE Rating IN ('G', 'PG') AND Runtime < 100;

Create a query to show the average runtimes of movies scoring below a 7.5 on imdb, grouped by their respective genres.

SELECT Genre, AVG(Runtime) AS AverageRuntime
FROM Movies
WHERE IMDB_Score < 7.5
GROUP BY Genre;

There's been a data entry mistake; Starship Troopers is actually rated R, not PG-13. Create a query that finds the movie by its title and changes its rating to R.

UPDATE Movies
SET Rating = 'R'
WHERE Title = 'Starship Troopers';

Show the ID number and rating of all of the Horror and Documentary movies in the database.

ALTER TABLE Movies
ADD COLUMN ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY;

This time let's find the average, maximum, and minimum IMDB score for movies of each rating.

SELECT Rating,
       AVG(IMDB_Score) AS AverageScore,
       MAX(IMDB_Score) AS MaxScore,
       MIN(IMDB_Score) AS MinScore
FROM Movies
GROUP BY Rating;

That last query isn't very informative for ratings that only have 1 entry. Use a HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 clause to only show ratings with multiple movies showing.

SELECT Rating,
       AVG(IMDB_Score) AS AverageScore,
       MAX(IMDB_Score) AS MaxScore,
       MIN(IMDB_Score) AS MinScore
FROM Movies
GROUP BY Rating
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;


Make the movie list more child-friendly. Delete all entries that have a rating of R. Remember to record your queries in a README.md file

DELETE FROM Movies
WHERE Rating = 'R';
